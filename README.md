# get-to-the-chopper
The GitHub hello-world tutorial, with my personal twist that the time honored hello world paradigm, should update to become get to the chopper !

Why Get to the Chopper?  I've had to adjust to getting older.   For example, it's March 25, 2018 and I'm creating my first GitHub project.  I used Microsoft products from Visual Source Safe to Team Foundation Server for the marjority of my career.  Lately I'v been using a SubVersion based envirionment.  Regardless, I've pretty much worked in business and as such have always had private repos.  Thus, making a first git repo today, makes me old.  Not bad.  Just a fact in the technology world.  I've still got my BAMF which I bring to the job each day.

Anyway, set ramble off, Get to the Chopper was funny to me when an intern showed it to me.  Then, when it was showed to me there's a project devoted to a language construct for this (https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC), it just seemed like the right time to update the time honored paradigm of hello world.  And clearly., that's get to the chopper (sometimes, get to the choppa)!

The man purpose of this file is to go through the tutorial for git.  I believe in trying to run a tutorial the first time you get into something, if it's available to you.
